# Valid Parentheses

# You are given a string s consisting of the following characters: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'.

# The input string s is valid if and only if:

# Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
# Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
# Return true if s is a valid string, and false otherwise.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "[]"

# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "([{}])"

# Output: true
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "[(])"

# Output: false
# Explanation: The brackets are not closed in the correct order.

# Min Stack
# Design a stack class that supports the push, pop, top, and getMin operations.

# MinStack() initializes the stack object.
# void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
# void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
# int top() gets the top element of the stack.
# int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
# Each function should run in 
# O(1) time.

# Example 1:

# Input: ["MinStack", "push", 1, "push", 2, "push", 0, "getMin", "pop", "top", "getMin"]

# Output: [null,null,null,null,0,null,2,1]

# Explanation:
# MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
# minStack.push(1);
# minStack.push(2);
# minStack.push(0);
# minStack.getMin(); // return 0
# minStack.pop();
# minStack.top();    // return 2

#Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

# You are given an array of strings tokens that represents a valid arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

# Daily Temperatures

# Car Fleet
# There are n cars traveling to the same destination on a one-lane highway.

# You are given two arrays of integers position and speed, both of length n.

# position[i] is the position of the ith car (in miles)
# speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour)
# The destination is at position target miles.

# A car can not pass another car ahead of it. It can only catch up to another car and then drive at the same speed as the car ahead of it.

# A car fleet is a non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. A single car is also considered a car fleet.

# If a car catches up to a car fleet the moment the fleet reaches the destination, then the car is considered to be part of the fleet.

# Return the number of different car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

# Example 1:

# Input: target = 10, position = [1,4], speed = [3,2]

# Output: 1
# Explanation: The cars starting at 1 (speed 3) and 4 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 10, the destination.

# Example 2:

# Input: target = 10, position = [4,1,0,7], speed = [2,2,1,1]

# Output: 3
# Explanation: The cars starting at 4 and 7 become a fleet at position 10. The cars starting at 1 and 0 never catch up to the car ahead of them. 
# Thus, there are 3 car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
